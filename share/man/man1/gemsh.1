\[sh]\[sh] DESCRIPTION
.LP
.PP
Generates a totally self\-contained environment for ruby gems\.
.LP
.PP
https:\[sl]\[sl]github\.com\[sl]regularfry\[sl]gemsh\[sh]readme
.LP
.SH USAGE
.LP
.nf
\[Do] gemenv <dirname>
.fi
.LP
.PP
This creates the following files:
.LP
.nf
<dirname>\[sl]
  bin\[sl]
    exec
    activate
  gem\e\[ru]home\[sl]
.fi
.LP
.PP
The \fBactivate\fR file contains shell script to set the \fBgem_home/\fR
directory as the ONLY place the \fBrequire\fR method will attempt to load
gems from, and the location where the \fBgem\fR and \fBbundle\fR commands will
install gems to\.
.LP
.PP
The \fBexec\fR script is a loader which sources the \fBactivate\fR script, and
runs whatever commands are passed on the command line\.  When working
on a project, use it like this:
.LP
.nf
\[Do] env\[sl]bin\[sl]exec \[sl]bin\[sl]bash
.fi
.LP
.PP
Running exec with a shell like this provides a subshell within which
the \fBgem\fR command Does The Right Thing, and where all binaries provided
by \fBgem install\fR are loaded from within the gem environment\.  To switch
environments, a Ctrl\-D quits the subshell\.  This makes binstubs
unnecessary, other than those that the \fBgem\fR command itself generates\.
.LP
.PP
Naturally, you can replace \fB/bin/bash\fR with any executable you want to
run in the environment\[cq]s context\.
.LP
.PP
This combination allows you to remove runtime dependencies on bundler
from your projects, avoid the \fBbundle exec...\fR dance, and keep your
gem environment in the same place as your project\.  Regenerating a gem
environment is simple: an \fBrm -rf <dirname>\fR removes the environment
completely, and \fBgem install bundler; bundle install\fR will reinstall the
gems you need from your \fBGemfile.lock\fR, if you have one\.
.LP
.PP
There are no limitations on the directory name for the environment
other than that it must be a valid path component\.  Meaningful gem
environment names replace named gemsets; the activated gem environment
name is available as the \[Do]VIRTUAL\[ru]ENV environment variable\.  This can
be added to your prompt like so:
.LP
.nf
\[Do] export PS1\[eq]\[dq](gems: \e\[Do]VIRTUAL\e\[ru]ENV)\en\[Do]PS1\[dq]
.fi
.LP
.PP
It is recommended to put your gem environments in the root of your
projects\.  If you use git, you can have it ignore the generated
environment by adding the gemenv name to \fB.git/info/exclude\fR\.  This file
is intentionally \fInot\fP tampered with by this script\.
.LP
.PP
If you use mercurial, you can have it ignore the generated environment
by adding the gemenv name to \fB.hg/hgignore\fR, and adding the following
to \fB.hg/hgrc\fR:
.LP
.nf
\[lB]ui\[rB] 
ignore\[eq]\.hg\[sl]hgignore
.fi
.LP
.PP
Different gem environments are required for different ruby versions:
binary gems built for MRI 1\.9, for instance, will segfault MRI 2\.0, and
vice versa\.
.LP
.PP
gemsh(1) is particularly useful when combined with a ruby environment
switcher such as chruby(1)\.  rv(1) combines these tools\.
.LP
.SH ARGUMENTS
.LP
.TP
\fIDIRNAME\fP
Root directory name for the generated gem environment\.
.LP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
.PP
Generate a gem environment at \fB.env\fR:
.LP
.nf
\[Do] gemenv \.env
.fi
.LP
.PP
Generate an environment for a rails app, load it and create an app with
the installed rails gem:
.LP
.nf
\[Do] gemenv rails\-env
\[Do] rails\-env\[sl]bin\[sl]exec rails myfunkyapp
.fi
.LP
.PP
or...
.LP
.nf
\[Do] gemenv rails\-env
\[Do] rails\-env\[sl]bin\[sl]exec \[sl]bin\[sl]bash
\[Do] rails myfunkyapp
.fi
.LP
.PP
The latter leaves the bash subshell running, from which you can quit
with a Ctrl\-D\.
.LP
.SH FILES
.LP
.TP
\fI\[Do]dirname\fP
Gem environment location\.  Can exist before running \fBgemsh\fR\.
.LP
.TP
\fI\[Do]dirname\[sl]exec\fP
Command runner\.  A command passed on the command\-line will be executed
with the gem environment activated\.
.LP
.TP
\fI\[Do]dirname\[sl]activate\fP
A bash script which sets the appropriate shell variables to activate
the gem environment for the shell in which it is sourced\.
.LP
.TP
\fI\[Do]dirname\[sl]gem\[ru]home\fP
The \[Do]GEM\[ru]HOME which is activated by \fBbin/exec\fR and \fBbin/activate\fR\.
